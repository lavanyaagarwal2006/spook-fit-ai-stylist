**Tagline:**
> AI-powered Halloween costume planner that generates personalized character recommendations in seconds

**What it does:**
SpookFit is an AI-powered Halloween costume recommendation platform that solves the annual struggle of finding the perfect costume. Users complete a 9-question quiz about their interests, style, budget, and preferences. Our AI then generates 5 specific, character-based costume recommendations (like "Miles Morales Spider-Man" or "Wednesday Addams") with detailed visual descriptions and reference photo links. For each costume, users can get comprehensive implementation guides with both buy and DIY paths, complete with shopping lists, step-by-step instructions, and budget estimates.

**How we built it:**
- **Frontend:** React with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn/ui components
- **Backend:** Lovable Cloud (Supabase) with serverless edge functions
- **AI:** Lovable AI Gateway using Google Gemini 2.5 Flash for costume generation and implementation guides
- **Design:** Custom Halloween-themed design system with purple/orange gradients and smooth animations

**Challenges we ran into:**
- Crafting AI prompts that consistently generated specific characters rather than generic costume types
- Managing context across multiple AI calls to avoid repeating suggestions
- Balancing detailed quiz questions with user-friendly UX
- Creating a design that was spooky but still professional and accessible

**Accomplishments that we're proud of:**
- Successfully integrated AI that truly understands nuanced user interests (e.g., Marvel fan ‚Üí specific Marvel characters)
- Built a complete end-to-end flow in just 2 days
- Created a production-ready app with proper error handling and loading states
- Designed a beautiful, responsive interface that works perfectly on mobile
- Implemented both costume generation AND detailed implementation guides

**What we learned:**
- Advanced prompt engineering techniques for consistent AI outputs
- Building production-ready AI applications with proper rate limiting
- Creating intuitive multi-step flows in React
- Balancing feature richness with simplicity
- Importance of visual references in decision-making

**What's next for SpookFit:**
- Social sharing functionality to share costume ideas with friends
- User accounts to save costume history across years
- Group costume coordination for families and friend groups
- Amazon affiliate integration for easier purchasing
- Tutorial video links for DIY paths
- Community ratings and photos of completed costumes
